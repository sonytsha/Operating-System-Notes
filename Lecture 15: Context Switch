Say process P1 is running in CPU right now. And say P2, P3, P4, P5, â€¦ are in ready queue.

If the scheduling is preemptive, it is possible that P1 could be removed and P2 starts running.

PCB( Process control block ) of P1 removed from CPU.

PCB of P2 posted into CPU.

Also registers, cache etc are refreshed.

When P1 is running, then that means OS ( which itself is a process ) is not running. So how will OS remove P1?

Using co-operative way
Wait for P1 to make a system call/software interrupt. OS takes control in interrupt mode and then scheduler is run by OS to check if some other process has to be moved or not.

2. Using non-cooperative way

H/w interrupt is used to have OS take back control. OS starts a timer of some t time at the beginning of execution of P1. As soon as the timer expires, the hardware sends H/w interrupt to CPU & OS takes the control back.

Cooperative mode alone is not sufficient. If P1 runs into infinite loop and we do not have non-cooperative way, OS will never be able to take back control.
