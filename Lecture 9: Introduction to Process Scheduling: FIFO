We start with these 4 assumptions to simplify the process scheduling algorithms:

All processes take finite amount of time
Once started (running), a process cannot be paused. [ No interrupt ]
Runtime of each process is known beforehand.
No process will be using and waiting for I/O (input/output).
Turnaround time: The time gap between the arrival of a process and its finishing time.

Avg turnaround time ( T_avg ): The average of turnaround times of  all the processes.

First In/First Out (FIFO) scheduling algorithm:


Say at t=0 ms, two processes arrive with runtime 10 ms.

P1 runs from 0 to 10 ms.

P2 runs from 10 ms to 20 ms.

Turn around times for 

P1: 10-0  = 10 ms

P2: 20-0  = 20 ms

Avg turnaround time = ( 10 ms  + 20 ms )/ 2 = 15 ms

Avg turnaround time would have been the same had we taken P2 first to run followed by P1.

In case the processes have different run times, FIFO does NOT minimize the average turnaround time.

It is the reason why FIFO is not a good scheduling algorithm.
