How many programs can CPU run at a time?

In a single core CPU, the CPU can execute only one program at a particular moment. But the OS can quickly switch between multiple programs: it can preempt an executing program and make another program execute. This gives an appearance to the user that all the programs are running simultaneously, but under the hood, itâ€™s the OS which is switching quickly between programs.




In the above diagram, 3 tasks - A,B and C are executed - without switching ( top ) and with switching ( bottom )
